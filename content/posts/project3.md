### Project Statement
This project is a digital rotoscope animation created in Adobe Photoshop. My project's goal was to discuss monuments that are celebrated even though one was absent for the sensation that created them. My focus was specifically on the many monumental events and dates in ones life that are celebrated although one was not present for the sensation that provides reason for celebration. The example I decided to focus on in this project is one’s own birth and the celebration of a birthday. A birthday is a date that everybody can relate to and thus why it was selected. One’s birth is something celebrated annually, although they themselves do not remember the sensation of their own birth. The animation itself is split into two sections, the process that goes into baking a cake and the birthday being celebrated with the cake. The creation of the cake symbolizes the birth itself with the viewer watching another individual making a cake, in order to visualize the separation from the process. The second section is the celebration itself, with the viewer being put in the celebrator’s point of view. A cake being made was selected to visualize this because it is another process with the one who is celebrating is typically not present for the process that goes into making it. 

### Questions for the Class:
1. Without reading the project statement what do you think the project is about?
2. After reading the statement. is the topic understandable? Does the animation fit the topic?
3. Is the seperation from viewing someone make the cake and the one who is enjoying the cake obvious? What could I have done to help seperate them more?
