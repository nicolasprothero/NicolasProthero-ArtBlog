### Desires and Aversions

Desire to Eat Local Food
- Personal desire to support local agriculture becomes political due to the government importing produce from other countries for cheaper costs and a demand for year round produce.

Desire to Follow Passions
- Personal and cultural desire to follow passions as a career becomes political due to many careers involving passions do not pay livable wages.

Aversion to Eat Processed Food
- Personal and cultural aversion to not consume processed foods clash with political as large companies are able to mass produce at cheaper and faster rates than fresh whole foods.
