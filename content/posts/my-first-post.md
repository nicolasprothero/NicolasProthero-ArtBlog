After almost two entire decades, Burger King's rebrand is a refreshing update to the old outdated look. Design wise the new campaign features a new color palette, a custom typeface, and modern yet retro illustrations. These are seen in the new packaging, digital promos, and even the uniforms.

It was quite hard for me to decide what my favorite art piece is. I decided on picking one of my favorite graphic design rebrand campaigns instead. The first one to come to mind was Burger King's 2021 rebrand.
