### About the Project / Derive Notes
This project uses Google Maps Street View in order to collect screenshots at a given location. These screenshots are then put into Photoshop's auto photomerge feature in order to combine all of the images into one image.

My first attempt I digitally wandered around Tokyo's Shibuya ward. My reasoning behind selecting this location was because it is near the school where my parents met, and it is a familar location as I have visited before. After wandering for a while, I stopped down a random side street and decided to do my first collage here. Although I was not specifically looking for the school and was doing more of an unplanned random walk through the city, I liked the idea of looking for a specific place.

Because of this, I decided that for my other collages I wanted to wander around specifically looking for a certain location. For this, I decided to look for locations from the film "Drive my Car" by Ryusuke Hamaguchi. After looking through the film for specific locations that I thought would work (typically one's near a road), I decided to search for them on Google Maps. 

These are the screencaps that I selected:

![Two People](../images/TwoPeople.png)
![Seaside](../images/seaside.png)
![Lone Person](../images/lone.png)
![Hotel and Car](../images/hotelcar.png)

Once I found the location, I took multiple screenshots in order to create a collage where then the screencap from the film could be inserted.

### Questions
1. Is there anything I could have done in order to improve these images? 
2. Are the movie screencaps well incorporated into the collages? Could it be improved?
3. What are some things I could do to add onto this idea and improve upon it?
