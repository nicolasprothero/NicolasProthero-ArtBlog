It was first created using collage and then digitally painted over in order to stylize and create a cohesive composition. The image’s goal was to focus on how one’s own perspective changes during times where they feel detached from their own body. These are times that are accompanied by a feeling of dissociation, mental fog, and a perception that people and things around you feel unreal or distant. I wanted the piece to feel as if it has two perspectives. The first perspective being through the audience looking at the subject and how when disassociating it can make one’s own perspective of others feel unreal or even somewhat blurry. The second perspective is how when one is disassociating they themselves can feel as if they have a blurred sense of identity or even almost watching themselves go about their day. The model of this piece is my good friend Fede and I decided on this image as it focuses on both the audience’s gaze on him and his gaze back at the audience. It was important to me to take both perspectives into account as I feel like they both play an equal role in the feeling of dissociation and disembodiment and thus both important to visually depict.\nQuestions for the Class: By just looking at the piece, is the topic easily understood or is context necessary? Can you relate to the piece in one way or another? Could something be changed in order to help others connect to it? Does the entire composition of the piece work or should something else have been added to it? How about the background? ",

<p>This project is a digital portrait created in Adobe Photoshop. It was first created using collage and then digitally painted over in order to stylize and create a cohesive composition. The image&rsquo;s goal was to focus on how one&rsquo;s own perspective changes during times where they feel detached from their own body. These are times that are accompanied by a feeling of dissociation, mental fog, and a perception that people and things around you feel unreal or distant. I wanted the piece to feel as if it has two perspectives. The first perspective being through the audience looking at the subject and how when disassociating it can make one&rsquo;s own perspective of others feel unreal or even somewhat blurry. The second perspective is how when one is disassociating they themselves can feel as if they have a blurred sense of identity or even almost watching themselves go about their day. The model of this piece is my good friend Fede and I decided on this image as it focuses on both the audience&rsquo;s gaze on him and his gaze back at the audience. It was important to me to take both perspectives into account as I feel like they both play an equal role in the feeling of dissociation and disembodiment and thus both important to visually depict.</p>
